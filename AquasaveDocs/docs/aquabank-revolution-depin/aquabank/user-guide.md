## Placement Instructions

- **Case A**: If there is sufficient space above the stopcocks:
    - AquaBank Saver does not need to be wall-mounted if it is secured over the two shut-off valves of the sink. 
    - Close the stopcocks under the sink and disconnect the hoses.
    - Make sure that the stopcocks are correctly aligned.
    - Install the AquaBank fittings over the stopcocks, adjusting the distance as necessary.
    - Connect the faucet hoses to the AquaBank top fittings, making sure not to cross the hot and cold water lines. Fully open the stopcocks, shut-off valves, and faucets to purge the system of air.
    - For different distances, two AquaBank Saver hoses should be used to carry water from the wall valves to the lower water couplings of the device. If other hoses from the market are used, we cannot guarantee the proper functioning of the device. Tighten the couplings with a 19mm wrench to prevent water leakage without damaging them.
