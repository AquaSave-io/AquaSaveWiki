## 3. Compatibility and Intended Use

AquaBank is a device designed to save water and energy wasted while waiting for hot water to arrive. Once installed, only hot water will be dispensed from the hot water tap. 

AquaBank is designed and compatible for homes that have their **OWN boiler, water heater or electric boiler**, compatible with geothermal and photosolar installations. 

It is not suitable for systems with a communal boiler or facilities that include a non-return valve that does not allow cold water to enter the boiler. The device does not heat or accumulate water; it uses the existing boiler, water heater, or water heater without requiring direct manipulation. It is installed under the sink and is activated with the opening of the faucet, extending its effect to all bathroom facilities.

### Electric Water Heater
AquaBank Saver functions correctly with any electric water heater. If a pressure reducer has been installed at the entrance of the electric water heater to protect it from potential overpressure from the water supply, ask the installer to place it at the entrance of the home instead. This adjustment protects the entire house's plumbing, not just the hot water line, as a pressure regulator like the one shown in the photo, at the entrance of an electric water heater, may cause AquaBank Saver to malfunction.

### Aerothermal Systems
AquaBank Saver works properly with any aerothermal system, but it's essential to check that no pressure regulator/reducer has been installed at the entrance of the storage tank, which would prevent the return of still-cold water to the aerothermal unit. If a pressure reducer has been installed at the entrance of the electric water heater to protect it from a possible overpressure of the water network, ask the installer to place it at the entrance of the residence to protect the entire house's installation and not just the hot water branch. A pressure regulator like the one in the photo at the entrance of the aerothermal storage tank can impede proper operation of AquaBank Saver.

### Thermosolar Panels
(capture heat from the sun and transfer it to a hot water storage tank) AquaBank Saver operates correctly with any thermosolar installation, but it is crucial to ensure that no pressure regulator/reducer has been placed at the entrance of the storage tank, which would block the return of cold water. If a pressure reducer has been installed at the entrance of the electric water heater to protect it from potential overpressure from the water network, ask the installer to position it at the entrance of the residence to protect the entire home's plumbing system and not just the hot water line, as a pressure regulator at the entrance of the thermosolar storage tank can cause AquaBank Saver to malfunction. Additionally, if a mixing valve has been installed at the hot water outlet, it can divert the recirculation through the cold water pipe, delaying the arrival of hot water. Simply closing it or reducing its flow can resolve this issue.

## 4. Operation

AquaBank recirculates the water that is not yet hot from the hot water pipe to the cold water pipe. It is installed between the stopcocks coming out of the wall under the sink and the hoses leading to the sink faucets or mixer taps.

## 5. Water Supply and Conditions of Use

The primary requirement for AquaBank Saver to function is that your home has sufficient water pressure, between 0.5 and 8 atmospheres/bars, (according to the Spanish Technical Building Code, the pressure in a residence should be between 1 and 5 atmospheres/bars). Probably this pressures will be impruves 

For AquaBank to function properly, your home must have sufficient water pressure, ideally between 1 and 5 atmospheres (14.7-73.5 Lb/in²). AquaBank can withstand up to 10 atmospheres (142 Lb/in²). Minimum instantaneous hot and cold water flow rates vary according to the type of fixture: for sinks, showers, and bathtubs. Bath and sink shut-off valves should be fully open to facilitate recirculation. It is important that pipes allow proper water flow; if they are clogged with scale, it may affect the operation of the device. In homes where boilers do not start properly, additional faucets may need to be opened to start the boiler.

The pipes must also allow the water to circulate properly, as if they are obstructed by limescale, it will hinder the proper functioning of our equipment, which, when attempting to pump, does not have enough flow to activate the boiler, which would cause, although AquaBank Saver is operational, the boiler or heater may not start. There are homes in which the boiler hardly ignites when opening the hot water tap, and it is sometimes necessary to open several faucets for it to start or during a shower, cold water may arrive because the boiler turns off when using lukewarm water. Once this heater problem is resolved, AquaBank Saver will function properly

## 6.Checking the operation of the gas or oil heater or boiler.

To check the start-up flow of your heater or boiler, slightly open a hot water tap from where you can see your heater. Imagine a stream as thick as a spaghetti strand. The heater will probably not start. Open the tap slightly more (a stream about half the thickness of a pencil) and check if it starts. It should perhaps ignite by now.... If not, continue to slightly increase the flow every 10 or 20 seconds until you finally confirm it starts.

With the boiler running and after confirming that the heater does not turn off after a few seconds, without changing the water flow coming from the tap, place a measuring jug or bottle under it to see how long it takes to fill 1 liter of water.

NOTE: If with that minimum start-up flow it takes 1 minute to fill the jug, it means that the start-up flow of your heater is 1 liter per minute. If it takes 30 seconds, it indicates that the start-up flow is 2 liters per minute. 20 seconds shows that the minimum start-up flow is 3 liters per minute.
Below that time, you likely have a heater that needs a check-up. 18 seconds or less to fill 1 liter of water is indicative of a heater that, when attempting to get lukewarm or tepid water, uncomfortably turns off and on during the shower, forcing you to turn the mixer tap completely to hot to get the heater to start again.

You should record the value of the minimum start-up flow, which you can read in the instructions or manual of your heater, and compare it with the value given by your test. The minimum start-up flows for each heater or boiler can also be found on the internet.

## 7. Placement Instructions

It is advisable to install AquaBank Saver in the most frequently used bathroom(s) in the house, and if it is the furthest one, its effect will cover all intermediate hot water faucets.

- **Case A**: If there is sufficient space above the stopcocks:
    - AquaBank Saver does not need to be wall-mounted if it is secured over the two shut-off valves of the sink. 
    - Close the stopcocks under the sink and disconnect the hoses.
    - Make sure that the stopcocks are correctly aligned.
    - Install the AquaBank fittings over the stopcocks, adjusting the distance as necessary.
    - Connect the faucet hoses to the AquaBank top fittings, making sure not to cross the hot and cold water lines. Fully open the stopcocks, shut-off valves, and faucets to purge the system of air.
    - For different distances, two AquaBank Saver hoses should be used to carry water from the wall valves to the lower water couplings of the device. If other hoses from the market are used, we cannot guarantee the proper functioning of the device. Tighten the couplings with a 19mm wrench to prevent water leakage without damaging them.

- **Case B**: If space is limited or you wish to install the device inside the sink cabinet:
    - Repeat the steps in case A to close the stopcocks and disconnect the hoses.
    - Use AquaBank specific extension hoses to reach the desired location of the fixture.
    - Use the template provided to mark and then install AquaBank on the wall or inside the lavatory cabinet.

## 8. Commissioning

Connect AquaBank to the nearest power source. The device is fully automatic and will activate when the hot water faucet is turned on for the first time. After this, you can configure through the App and connect to the AquaSave network.

## 9. Ways to Operate AquaBank

- **A**: Activation by opening and closing the hot water tap. The device will advertise to indicate that the hot water has reached the desired temperature and is ready for use.
- **B**: Holding the hot water tap open until the device automatically allows hot water to flow out.
- **C**: You can activate the AquaBank via our AquaSaveApp, by voice commands (using Alexa) or by programming a schedule.
