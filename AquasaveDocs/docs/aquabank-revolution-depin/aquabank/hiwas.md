# How It Works: AquaBank Saver

![hiwas](/img/depin/hiwas.png)

**AquaBank Saver** is a device installed under any home sink without the need for construction work (between the water valves and the hoses that connect these to the faucet). It **saves water** by preventing waste while it heats up.

When the user opens the hot water tap, **AquaBank detects it and stops the flow** through the tap; instead, it connects the hot water pipes with the cold water pipes through an internal circuit. Instantly, the activation of an internal water pump forces the recirculation of water from the hot water pipes to the boiler's inlet (through the cold water pipes), triggering the boiler's activation. Thus, the water gradually heats up to a preset temperature, after which the device returns to its resting state, allowing hot water to flow through the tap **without wasting a single drop** in the process.

Moreover, as the water temperature at the boiler's inlet is increasingly higher, it **uses less energy** to heat it. This way, **AquaBank not only saves water but also reduces the energy required to heat it.**

It is very easy to install under the sink as it allows for greater aesthetic discretion and proximity to an electrical outlet. However, by heating the entire circuit—from the boiler to the bathroom and up to the sink faucet—the other taps in the bathroom also have almost immediate access to hot water. The **AquaBank Saver can also be installed in kitchen sinks**.

Additionally, through the mobile app, users can view real-time consumption data, configure the device's operation, and manage their earnings in the form of daily rewards in the **"AQC" token**.
