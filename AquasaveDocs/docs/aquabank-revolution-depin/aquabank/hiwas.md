# How It Works

![hiwas](/img/depin/hiwas.png)

**AquaBank Saver** is a device installed under any home sink without the need for construction work. It is placed between the water valves and the hoses that connect these to the faucet. It **saves water** by preventing waste while it heats up.

When the user opens the hot water tap, **AquaBank detects it and stops the flow** through the tap; instead, it connects the hot water pipes with the cold water pipes through an internal circuit. Instantly, the activation of an internal water pump forces the recirculation of water from the hot water pipes to the boiler's inlet (through the cold water pipes), triggering the boiler's activation. Thus, the water gradually heats up to a preset temperature, after which the device returns to its resting state, allowing hot water to flow through the tap **without wasting a single drop** in the heating process.

When the water is at the temperature set by the user, **it can be used in the rest of the hot water points in the house almost immediately**.

Moreover, as the water temperature at the boiler's/heater’s inlet is increasingly higher, it **uses less energy** to heat it. This way, **AquaBank not only saves water but also reduces the energy required to heat it.**

It is very easy to install under the bath's sink as it allows for greater aesthetic discretion and proximity to an electrical outlet. The **AquaBank Saver can also be installed in kitchen sinks**.

Additionally, through the mobile app users can manage the device, view real-time consumption data, configure the device's operation, and manage their earnings in the form of daily rewards in the **"AQC" token**.

The device is in continuous development, so **tons of features will be incorporated** such as access to an open API, compatibility with Alexa and smart home applications, prevention of pipe freezing, etc.

## Key Features
- **Comfort from the first use and effortless water saving.**
- **A single device installed under the sink services the entire home\*.**
- **It can be easily installed without the need for construction work.**
- **It saves energy by reintegrating warm water back into the boiler's/heater’s inlet.**
- **Its mains plug does not block the use of other electrical devices.**
- **It automatically turns off the hot water tap if you forget it open.**
- **Developed and manufactured in Spain.**
- **Holds various awards and certifications.**
- **Valid for geothermal and solar thermal systems.**

\* In multi-floor/large dwellings, it may be necessary to install more than one AquaBank Saver to achieve efficient operation.
