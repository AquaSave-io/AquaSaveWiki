# Troubleshooting

## Issues due to valves or accessories

### Non-return Valves
AquaBank Saver is a device that recirculates hot water through cold water pipes. In some installations, non-return valves are incorrectly installed at the inlet of the water heating system. This type of installation would make the water recirculation achieved by the AquaBank device impossible.

The non-return valves, except in some cases, should be located at the water mains of the house.

### Pressure Regulator/Reducer Valves
If a pressure reducer has been installed at the entrance of the electric water heater to protect it from potential overpressure from the water supply, ask the installer to place it at the entrance of the home instead. This adjustment protects the entire house's plumbing, not just the hot water line, at the entrance of an water heater/boiler, may cause AquaBank Saver to malfunction.

### Mixing Valves
If a mixing valve has been installed at the hot water heater's outlet, it can divert the recirculation through the cold water pipe, delaying the arrival of hot water. Simply closing it or reducing its flow can resolve this issue.

## Water Supply Conditions

The primary requirement for AquaBank Saver to function is that your home has sufficient water pressure, between 0.5 and 8 atmospheres/bars, (according to the Spanish Technical Building Code, the pressure in a residence should be between 1 and 5 atmospheres/bars). Probably this pressures will be improved with the use of AquaBank Saver.

For AquaBank to function properly, your home must have sufficient water pressure, ideally between 1 and 5 atmospheres (14.7-73.5 Lb/in²). AquaBank can withstand up to 10 atmospheres (142 Lb/in²). Minimum instantaneous hot and cold water flow rates vary according to the type of fixture: for sinks, showers, and bathtubs. Bath and sink shut-off valves should be fully open to facilitate recirculation. 

## Water Pipelines Conditions

It is important that pipes allow proper water flow; if they are clogged with scale, it may affect the operation of the device.

The pipes must also allow the water to circulate properly, as if they are obstructed by limescale, it will hinder the proper functioning of our equipment, which, when attempting to pump, does not have enough flow to activate the boiler, which would cause, although AquaBank Saver is operational, the boiler or heater may not start. 

## Water Heater Conditions

There are homes in which the boiler hardly ignites when opening the hot water tap, and it is sometimes necessary to open several faucets for it to start or during a shower, cold water may arrive because the boiler turns off when using lukewarm water. Once this heater problem is resolved, AquaBank Saver will function properly

To check the start-up flow of your heater or boiler, slightly open a hot water tap from where you can see your heater. Imagine a stream as thick as a spaghetti strand. The heater will probably not start. Open the tap slightly more (a stream about half the thickness of a pencil) and check if it starts. It should perhaps ignite by now.... If not, continue to slightly increase the flow every 10 or 20 seconds until you finally confirm it starts.

With the boiler running and after confirming that the heater does not turn off after a few seconds, without changing the water flow coming from the tap, place a measuring jug or bottle under it to see how long it takes to fill 1 liter of water.

NOTE: If with that minimum start-up flow it takes 1 minute to fill the jug, it means that the start-up flow of your heater is 1 liter per minute. If it takes 30 seconds, it indicates that the start-up flow is 2 liters per minute. 20 seconds shows that the minimum start-up flow is 3 liters per minute.
Below that time, you likely have a heater that needs a check-up. 18 seconds or less to fill 1 liter of water is indicative of a heater that, when attempting to get lukewarm or tepid water, uncomfortably turns off and on during the shower, forcing you to turn the mixer tap completely to hot to get the heater to start again.

You should record the value of the minimum start-up flow, which you can read in the instructions or manual of your heater, and compare it with the value given by your test. The minimum start-up flows for each heater or boiler can also be found on the internet.
