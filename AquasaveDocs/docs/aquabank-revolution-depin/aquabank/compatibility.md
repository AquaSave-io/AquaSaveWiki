# Compatibility Information

## Before You Buy the AquaBank

**Dear Customer:** Before purchasing your AquaBank Saver, it is essential that you read this compatibility documentation and instructions to ensure the correct operation as soon as you receive the AquaBank Saver.

## Compatibility with Your Water Heating System

AquaBank Saver **is compatible** with the following individual water heating systems:
- **Electric water boiler:** an electric boiler utilizes electrical energy to heat water, which is then stored in a tank typically ranging from 30 to 200 liters in capacity. 
- **Electric water heater:** an electric water heater heats water using electricity. Most models include a small internal tank to store hot water, ensuring faster access to hot water.
- **Gas fired water heater:** a gas-fired water heater uses gas as the main energy source to heat water. 
- **Aerothermal heat pump:** an aerothermal heat pump extracts energy from the air to provide cooling in summer, heating in winter, and domestic hot water year-round. It uses a thermodynamic cycle to transfer heat from the outside air to an indoor space or vice versa.
- **Solar thermal water heating:** solar thermal energy harnesses sunlight to generate thermal energy, which can be used for domestic water heating. AÃ±adir placas
- **Individual heating systems with communal heating systems support:** some of the individual heating systems mentioned earlier (electric boiler/heater and gas fired water heater) are complemented by communal heating systems, such as solar thermal or aerothermal systems.

AquaBank Saver **is compatible but may not be optimal** with the following water heating systems:
- **Vented/Unvented point-of-use water heaters (calentadores localizados que tienen acumulador):** Vented or unvented point-of-use water heaters are small units installed directly at the location where hot water is needed when there is no central water heater for the entire house or when it is too far from the point of use. These heaters usually come with a small storage tank to hold a limited amount of hot water.
- **Instantaneous point-of-use water heaters (calentadores localizados que no tienen acumulador):** Instantaneous point-of-use water heaters are small, on-demand units installed directly at the location where hot water is needed when there is no central water heater for the entire house or when it is too far from the point of use. These heaters provide hot water immediately without the need for a storage tank.

AquaBank Saver **is not compatible** with the following water heating systems:

- **Communal water heating systems (or district heating systems):** these systems provide hot water to multiple buildings or residences from a centralized source. This system typically includes a large boiler or heat plant that heats water and distributes it through a network of insulated pipes to individual units. Since hot water usually passes through an individual meter that contains an anti-return valve, this type of installation is incompatible with the AquaBank Saver device.
- **Point-of-use tap electric water heater (hand wash tap or shower tap):** a point-of-use tap electric water heater is a compact unit installed directly at the location where hot water is needed, such as a sink or shower tap. It heats water instantly by consuming a significant amount of energy. Because these devices are located at the faucet itself, whether for a hand wash or shower, they are not compatible with the AquaBank device.

## Connection to the mains

AquaBank Saver requires a connection to the electricity mains. It has a plug with a 1.9m long cable, so it is necessary that at the point where it is installed there is a nearby mains socket or the use of an power extension cord.
