# Buy AquaBank

At the heart of the project is AquaBank, a line of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that enable water monitoring and saving. Also, AquaBank serves as bridge that connects users to a complex ecosystem of services, centralized in our App and web platform. 

Every day, in each household, from the moment a hot water tap is opened until the water reaches the desired temperature, a significant amount of water is allowed to run down the drain. This water is not only wasted but also becomes a costly waste to process. Statistically, this amounts to 12 liters of water per shower, which constitutes 33% of the total water used for showering. Daily, this happens 506 million times in 220 million homes across Europe, and 1.265 billion times for other uses of hot water in homes. Efforts have been made to discourage the unsustainable use of hot water, which accounts for about 23% of total water consumption in cities.

The first model, AquaBank Saver, is an evolution of AquaReturn, a device patented and sold internationally for more than 10 years. With this compact device that is installed under the sink, when water is used before it is hot, it is recirculated through the cold water pipes without wasting a single drop, until it reaches the desired temperature, resulting in significant savings of both water and energy.  Once the water reaches the temperature chosen by the user, the device allows the water to exit the faucet. 

It also includes some other functions like monitoring pressure, and flow levels, detecting bad quality in the water, eliminating legionella, detecting water leaks and losses, and preventing frozen pipes. Additionally, it is the first IoT device designed to provide information and recommendations for efficient water and energy usage. It allows programming the desired temperature, generating alerts, and having hot water available throughout the water network.

Through them, users can obtain real-time information about the status of the water network and earn AquaCoin (AQC) tokens through our ecosystem of anonymous data sales and the creation of water footprint certificates. This entire process is supported by the Solana Blockchain, which guarantees the authenticity and origin of the data.

COMING DEVICES
AquaBank Meter is designed to help you stay on top of your water usage. They can identify leaks, measure water pressure, and provide you with detailed insights into your water consumption. This ensures accurate billing and helps you track and reduce unnecessary water wastage. These meters allow water companies to have detailed information on water quality and consumption at the interested points of the supply network in real time. 

AquaBank Sense is focused on water quality control. They can detect critical parameters such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH, conductivity, and temperature, helping to ensure safe and clean water usage. This high-precision devices and sensors could monitor rivers and seas, and water quality control in facilities such as fish farms or swimming pools. This will allow for the anticipation of potential contaminations and unhealthy water.
