# What is AquaSave

AquaSave is an innovative DePIN project committed to addressing the global water crisis by creating an ecosystem that integrates a network of IoT devices, the use of smart data analysis and Blockchain technologies, and incentivizes community participation for monitoring and analyzing the situation of the planet's water resources.

With water scarcity projected to become the number one global risk in the next decade, millions of liters wasted in different scenarios, and the lack of real-time measurement; AquaSave recognizes the urgent need to take action. Our vision is to change the way the world interacts with water, building a sustainable and environmentally friendly ecosystem around this vital resource. Thanks to AquaSave's technology we can minimize water consumption and waste while promoting and encouraging the implementation of successful policies in various contexts.

AquaSave's market objectives include key players in water management and conservation, such as Water and Energy Suppliers, Private Companies, Public Institutions & Governments, all of them interested in integrating technologies for better water management to ensure its availability to the population, in addition to reducing consumption and waste by the population. Also, individual Customers who are interested in reducing their billing costs, are environmentally conscious or interested in receiving incentives and discounts.

The market size is considerable, as water scarcity and quality are global issues affecting all industries and people. Additionally, by issuing water footprint certificates, we will stand out in a new market with enormous potential.
