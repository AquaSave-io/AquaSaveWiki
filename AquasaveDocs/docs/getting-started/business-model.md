# AquaSave’s Business Model

AquaSave’s business model revolves around two core streams: **B2B2C Device Sales & Subscription Services**, and **B2B2G Data Monetization**.

## B2B2C Device Sales & Subscription Services

In the **B2B2C** segment, AquaSave markets its IoT devices directly to consumers and businesses, generating revenue from the sales of these devices along with subscription services for device maintenance and data analysis. These devices enable users to monitor and reduce water consumption, offering a practical solution to save water and contribute to environmental sustainability. The reduction in consumption also maximizes ROI through energy and water savings. Target customers include those familiar with the cryptocurrency ecosystem or cryptocurrency investors, customers interested in eco-sustainable projects, and corporations looking to save and obtain a return on investment.

These **businesses focus** on **reducing consumption** and **maximizing ROI through energy and water savings**, aiming to decrease chemical use and CO2 emissions, which enhances their capability to manage larger water volumes without additional resources.

**Public institutions** such as governments, communities, city councils, and health departments are all **potential users of our services** and can actively promote the use of our devices. By encouraging their adoption, these institutions can benefit significantly as reduced water usage lowers the demand for pre- and post-use water treatment, thus decreasing operational costs and environmental impact.

Additionally, **water service providers involved in distributing water and energy**, along with companies related to water facilities and services—including manufacturers and distributors of boilers, alternative energy equipment, solar water heating panels, and environmental products, as well as architectural firms, construction companies, and sectors in healthcare and hospitality—are all key stakeholders that can distribute our monitoring technologies. These varied sectors underscore the broad applicability and necessity of our advanced water management solutions in promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency.

## B2B2G Data Monetization

In the **B2B2G** stream, AquaSave **capitalizes on the data collected from its IoT devices** by using a **token economy model where water usage data is converted into digital assets**. This data is invaluable for public institutions and private companies seeking insights into water management. These stakeholders, including governments, communities, city councils, and health departments, utilize the data to numerically demonstrate efficient water management, from its production and usage to its treatment as waste, highlighting the economic and environmental savings from minimizing water wastage.

Furthermore, **water service provider companies and businesses involved in water-related facilities and services**, including gas and water distributors, **can leverage this data to provide lower rates and improve service offerings to their customers** and public entities. These companies, along with others in the water ecosystem, have the opportunity to invest in water initiatives or acquire **water footprint certificates**. These certificates, representing measured and **verified water savings or efficient management**, enable both companies and governments to showcase their commitment to sustainable practices. By acquiring water footprint bonds, companies can also offset or neutralize their environmental impact, contributing to broader water conservation projects and reinforcing their dedication to environmental sustainability.

Together, these streams position AquaSave as an innovative player in the water conservation industry, leveraging technology to make a significant environmental impact while offering value to individual and institutional customers.
