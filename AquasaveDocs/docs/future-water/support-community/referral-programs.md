## Introduction to the Referral Program

At AquaSave, we value and recognize our users' contributions to the growth of our community. The Referral Program is designed to reward those who help expand the AquaSave network by encouraging friends, acquaintances, and neighbors to install AquaBank in their homes.

## Referral Program Mechanism

### Registration and Participation:

- When a user purchases an AquaBank and connects their wallet like Phantom and their X account during the purchase process, they are automatically enrolled in the Referral Program and gain access to their personal Leaderboard.
- A unique referral link is generated, which the user can share with their close circle.

### Operation of the Leaderboard:

- Each confirmed purchase of an AquaBank made through the referral link adds points to the ranking of the user who shared their link.
- The leaderboard is updated periodically to reflect the real-time rankings, thus encouraging healthy competition among users.

### Rewards and Bonuses:

- Users who achieve certain milestones in the number of referrals will receive bonuses in AQC tokens.
- The leaderboard will particularly highlight users with the highest number of referrals and those who reach significant milestones in the program.

## Benefits of the Referral Program

### Tangible Incentives:

- AQC tokens not only serve as recognition of our users' efforts but can also be used within the AquaSave ecosystem to obtain discounts and other benefits.

### Community Growth:

- By motivating users to introduce AquaBank to new people, the program helps expand the network of users aware of water use, thus multiplying the positive impact of our solutions.

### Ongoing Engagement:

- The leaderboard and milestone bonuses encourage continuous and active participation of users in the AquaSave community.

1. Purchase and set up an AquaBank by connecting it to their Phantom wallet.
