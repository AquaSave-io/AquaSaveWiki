# FAQ

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## Does AquaBank require any special requirements for installation?
No, AquaBank does not require any special installation requirements. It integrates seamlessly with your existing water heating system. A single device placed under the sink can serve all bathroom taps, making it both efficient and convenient.

## Can I install AquaBank myself or do I need an installer?
AquaBank is designed for easy self-installation. You can install it yourself by following the simple instructions and template included in the product box. This DIY approach is intended to make the setup process straightforward for all users.

## Where is it recommended to install AquaBank?
It is most convenient to install an AquaBank under the bathroom sink. This location is typically the furthest from the boiler and where hot water takes the longest to arrive, resulting in the most water wastage. By installing it under the sink, AquaBank can effectively reduce this wastage and provide quicker access to hot water.

## What dimensions should the space for installing AquaBank have?
To install AquaBank, ensure that the installation space accommodates the following device dimensions:
- Length: 21.8 cm (8.58 inches)
- Width: 13 cm (5.12 inches)
- Height: 10.6 cm (4.17 inches)
These dimensions provide the necessary space for optimal installation and function of the AquaBank device.

## How long is the cable of the AquaBank device?
The cable of the AquaBank device is 2 meters (approximately 6.56 feet) long. This length allows for flexible installation options and can accommodate various bathroom layouts without requiring additional extension cords.

## What if my outlet is further away and the cable doesn't reach?
For safety reasons, especially in humid areas like the bathroom, it is recommended to use an extension cord that includes a ground connection. This ensures safety and allows greater flexibility in the placement of the AquaBank device.

## Is it possible to install AquaBank at the boiler's outlet to serve the whole house?
The current design of the AquaBank device is optimized for placement under the bathroom sink to maximize water and energy savings. Installing it directly at the boiler's outlet is not recommended as it would not address the issue of cooling in the pipes. The cold pipes would still allow the water to cool as it travels through them, leading to inefficiencies.

## Does my boiler or heater need to meet any special requirements?
No, the type of heater or boiler does not need to meet any specific requirements to use AquaBank. However, it is important to ensure that your heater or boiler starts correctly according to the flow rates specified in its instruction manual. Proper operation according to these guidelines will ensure optimal functionality of the AquaBank device.

## Can I install AquaBank if I have a centralized community hot water sanitation (ACS) installation?
AquaBank is currently not designed for use with centralized community ACS installations. It is specifically developed for installations in individual homes with their own heaters, thermal baths, or boilers. This ensures that AquaBank can effectively optimize water and energy savings at the point of use.

## Do I need a device for each bathroom?
Ideally, an AquaBank device should be installed in each bathroom that experiences the most hot water usage. This is particularly recommended in multi-story single-family homes or in cases where bathrooms are significantly distanced from each other. Installing a device in each of these bathrooms helps optimize water and energy savings effectively throughout the home.

## How much water can I save with AquaBank?
The final water savings with AquaBank depend on several factors, including daily hot water usage in the home, the number of people living together, type of housing, and the local water temperature. On average, AquaBank can save about 28 liters (approximately 7.4 gallons) of water per person per day. This equates to roughly 10,000 liters (about 2,641 gallons) per person per year.

## How does AquaBank work in homes with individual solar collectors?
In homes that use solar collectors for heating water, AquaBank is especially beneficial for saving both water and thermal energy. The device is designed to complement the solar heating system by using its pump to overcome the load losses, such as friction, inside the pipes on the return path to the heat source. This efficiency helps in maximizing the use of solar-heated water while minimizing wastage.
