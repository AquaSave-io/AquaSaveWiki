# AIRDROP

## Aqua Points: Accumulation and Benefits

**AquaSave** introduces an innovative reward system called **Aqua Points**, designed to engage and reward the community actively. These points are crucial for participating in the **AQC token airdrop** and are accumulated through various activities within the AquaSave network.

### Initial Points Distribution
- **Early Discord Users**: The first 1000 users to join our Discord server will receive **1000 Aqua Points** each, totaling **1 million Aqua Points** distributed to this initial user base.

### Social Media Participation
- **Engage Bot**: Using our social media engagement bot, users can earn points by performing simple actions:
    - **Like**: 20 Aqua Points
    - **Retweet (RT)**: 5 Aqua Points
    - **Comments**: 25 Aqua Points
    - A maximum of **50 Aqua Points** is available per individual post.

### Interactive Activities
- **AMAs and X Spaces**: Participating in Ask Me Anything (AMAs) sessions and exclusive spaces on Twitter Spaces will grant users **100 Aqua Points** per event.
- **Events, Games, and Contests**: These activities are additional opportunities to accumulate Aqua Points, with rewards varying based on the nature and level of participation in each event.

### Points Multipliers
- **Purchasing AquaBank**:
    - Buying one AquaBank will **double** the Aqua Points accumulated by a user.
    - Buying two AquaBanks will **triple** the points.
    - This multiplier continues to increase with each additional AquaBank purchased, incentivizing not just participation but also investment in AquaSave's infrastructure.

### Conversion and Airdrop of AQC Tokens
- **Conversion Ratio**: The conversion rate of Aqua Points to AQC tokens is yet to be defined. It will be announced soon, ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution of rewards.
- **Airdrop Fund**: 8% of the total supply of AQC tokens is reserved for airdrops. These missions and tasks will be announced and are designed to boost adoption and engagement within the AquaSave network and its audience in the Physical Decentralized Infrastructure (DePIN).
