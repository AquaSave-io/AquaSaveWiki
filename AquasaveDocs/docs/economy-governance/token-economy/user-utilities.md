## User Utilities: AquaCoin as a Utility Token

AquaCoin AQC$ is classified as a utility token within the AquaSave ecosystem. The primary mission of AQC$ is to sustain and propel a sustainable economy within the AquaSave network through a dynamic 'burn & mint' system.

### Burn & Mint Dynamics
- This process requires users interested in accessing exclusive services to periodically possess and burn a specific amount of AQC$ tokens to maintain access to these valuable advantages. This mechanism not only ensures a constant demand for the token but also contributes to its long-term value.
