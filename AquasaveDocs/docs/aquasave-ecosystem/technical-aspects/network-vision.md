     - Historical statistics, displaying data based on past records stored in a specialized IoT cloud environment.
     - Scheduling features that allow users to program when they want their water to be heated, ensuring hot water availability according to their personal needs and schedules.

   3.2 [**Map Explorer for Users**](#user-guides/map-dashboard-users)
      - This feature allows users to visualize real-time and historical data on water usage across different geographies, publicly available from all devices registered on the blockchain.  
    The Map Explorer helps users understand broader water usage trends and their individual impact.
         
   3.3 [**Dashboard Pro**](#user-guides/dashboard-pro)
      - An advanced version of the standard dashboard designed for institutions and companies. This dashboard offers enhanced analytical tools, deeper data insights, and more granular control over water management systems. Additionally, users can manage their water footprint certificates, allowing for detailed tracking and reporting of their water conservation efforts.


4. **Cloud Technology**
   - Cloud technology plays a crucial role in the AquaSave system, providing a robust platform for secure data storage and management. Utilizing the cloud allows for the centralized collection and analysis of data from across the network. This technology ensures that all data, whether it's from AquaBank, AquaMeter, or AquaSense devices, is securely stored in highly protected data centers that employ advanced encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.

   - The benefits of using cloud technology in the AquaSave system are manifold. Accessibility is one of the primary advantages; users and administrators can access data anytime and from anywhere, as long as they have internet connectivity. This accessibility enhances the flexibility and efficiency of managing water resources. Additionally, cloud security measures are top-notch, with continuous updates to safeguard against potential cyber threats and data breaches. These security protocols ensure that sensitive data related to water usage and management remains protected at all times.
